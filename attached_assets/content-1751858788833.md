The court upheld the Judgments Act rate of 8% interest on costs, subject to certain deductions due to delays.

The main costs issues revolved around the reasonableness of the costs claimed for prosecuting Timothy Shinners for fraud and theft. The initial assessment significantly reduced Fuseon's costs, citing disproportionate claims and the use of a London-based law firm rather than a local one.

The primary issue was whether the claimant was entitled to pre-judgment interest on the disbursement, which was incurred for an expert medical report. The claimant argued that the costs could not have been pursued without the loan, but the court ultimately refused the application.

William MackenzieRead more Costs budget cap2020-07-10Marbrow v Sharpes Garden Services Ltd [2020] EWHC B26 (Costs)This case involved a detailed assessment of the Claimant's costs following a successful personal injury claim against his employer, Sharpes Garden Services Limited. Senior Costs Judge Gordon-Saker addressed three key issues: (1) Whether the caps on recoverable costs in Practice Direction 3E of the Civil Procedure Rules exclude VAT. The judge concluded that the caps do exclude VAT because the costs budget figures used in the calculation do not include VAT. (2) The recoverability of interest paid on a disbursement funding loan. The judge determined that interest paid on a loan for funding disbursements could not be recovered as costs, based on the Court of Appeal's decision in Hunt v RM Douglas (Roofing) Ltd [1987]. However, the court could order interest on costs from a date before judgment under CPR 44.2(6)(g). (3) The Defendant's argument that the Claimant's entitlement to interest should start from three months after the order for costs was rejected. The judge found no particular circumstances justifying a departure from the default rule that interest runs from the date of judgment. William MackenzieRead more Court of Protection2020-09-30PLK & Ors (Court of Protection : Costs) [2020] EWHC B28 (Costs)This case involved a common point of principle regarding the assessment of hourly rates claimed by Deputies in the Court of Protection (COP). Master Whalan reviewed the approach taken by Costs Officers and Costs Judges when assessing COP costs and whether the Guideline Hourly Rates (GHR) of 2010 were still appropriate. The Applicants argued that COP work should be assessed using a more flexible approach, treating the GHR as a starting point rather than a fixed ceiling. Master Whalan acknowledged that COP work can involve substantial responsibility and complexity, and agreed that the GHR should be subject to some form of uplift to reflect inflation and changing commercial conditions. He directed that, moving forward, hourly rates up to 120% of the 2010 GHR should be considered prima facie reasonable for COP work, allowing for greater flexibility in assessments. William MackenzieRead more Default Costs Certificate (DCC)2020-12-15Masten v London Britannia Hotel Ltd [2020] EWHC B31 (Costs)This case involved an application by the Defendant, London Britannia Hotel Ltd, to set aside a Default Costs Certificate (DCC) issued in favor of the Claimant, Sharifah Masten. The DCC was issued because the Defendant failed to serve points of dispute within the required timeframe after the settlement of a personal injury claim. The primary issues revolved around whether the application to set aside the DCC was made promptly and whether there was good reason for the detailed assessment to continue. Master Leonard concluded that the Defendant's default was serious and significant, and there was no good reason for it. Although the Defendant eventually filed an application to set aside the DCC, the lengthy delays, lack of urgency in remedying the default, and the prejudice caused to the Claimant led the court to refuse the application. The judgment emphasized the importance of adhering to procedural rules and timelines to ensure the efficient administration of justice. William MackenzieRead more Clinical Negligence2021-01-29Best v Luton & Dunstable Hospital NHS Foundation Trust [2021] EWHC B2 (Costs)This case involved the issue of whether the Claimant could rely on a Part 36 offer in relation to the costs of detailed assessment proceedings. The detailed assessment of the Claimant's costs in a clinical negligence claim had been settled, but after the summary assessment hearing concluded, the Claimant sought to raise a Part 36 offer related to the assessment costs. Costs Judge Leonard allowed the issue to be raised post-hearing, noting that the hearing had not truly ended as the point was raised within the originally allocated time. However, the judge ultimately refused the Claimant's argument that the costs of the detailed assessment could be treated as an "independent claim" under CPR 47.20(7). The court held that while detailed assessment proceedings are treated as independent for the purpose of applying Part 36, the costs of those proceedings themselves do not constitute an independent issue that could trigger a Part 36 award. This decision was partly based on concerns about potential "parasitic" cycles of costs assessments if Part 36 were applicable in this manner, which would be contrary to the overriding objective of proportionality and fairness.
