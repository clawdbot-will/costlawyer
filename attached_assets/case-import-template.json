    "content": "# Brown v NHS Trust [2024] EWHC 234 (QB)\n\n## Summary\nThis judgment sets new precedent for costs budgeting in clinical negligence claims.\n\n## Participants\n- Margaret Brown (Claimant)\n- Central NHS Trust (Defendant)\n- Justice Williams\n- Ms. Sarah Thompson QC (for the Claimant)\n- Mr. Robert Jackson QC (for the Defendant)\n\n## Background\nThe claimant suffered serious injuries during surgery and brought a claim against the NHS Trust. At the costs management conference, there was significant dispute about the appropriate level of costs for expert evidence and trial preparation.\n\n## Highlights\n> \"The purpose of costs budgeting is not to reduce costs to their minimum possible level, but to ensure they are reasonable, proportionate and necessary.\"\n\n> \"In complex clinical negligence matters where causation is in dispute, a more generous approach to expert fees may be justified.\"\n\n## Key Principles\n1. Proportionality must be judged against the specific circumstances of the case\n2. The complexity of expert evidence may justify higher costs\n3. Efficiency in litigation process should be considered\n\n## Outcome\nThe court approved a costs budget with modifications, allowing most of the expert fees but reducing the trial preparation contingency by 25%.",

    "content": "# Wilson & Co v Thompson [2024] EWHC 345 (Costs)\n\n## Summary\nThis case addresses the enforceability of a conditional fee agreement (CFA) and the reasonableness of success fees in commercial litigation.\n\n## Participants\n- Wilson & Co Solicitors (Claimant)\n- James Thompson (Defendant/Former Client)\n- Deputy Costs Judge Mitchell\n\n## Key Issues\n- Whether the CFA was compliant with regulations\n- The adequacy of risk assessment for the success fee\n- Whether information provided to the client was sufficient\n\n## Legal Background\nThe Defendant had instructed the Claimant in commercial litigation under a CFA with a 100% success fee. After successful resolution, the Defendant challenged the enforceability of the CFA and the reasonableness of the success fee.\n\n## Highlights\n> \"A solicitor must provide sufficient information to enable the client to make an informed decision about the funding arrangement. This requires more than mechanical recitation of terms.\"\n\n> \"The level of success fee must be justified by a proper assessment of risk at the time the CFA was entered into, not by reference to hindsight.\"\n\n## Outcome\nThe court found the CFA to be enforceable but reduced the success fee from 100% to 50%, finding that the initial risk assessment had not justified the higher percentage.",
