  "content": "# Santiago v MIB [2025] EWHC 270 (Costs)\n\n## Summary\nThis case concerns the assessment of interpreter fees as a disbursement following a Court of Appeal decision that such fees are recoverable in principle under CPR 45.29I(h).\n\n## Participants\n- Raphael De Lima Santiago (Claimant)\n- Motor Insurance Bureau (Defendant)\n- His Hon Judge Dight CBE (Judge)\n- Ben Williams KC (for the Claimant)\n- Robert Marven KC (for the Defendant)\n\n## Background\nThe claimant, a Brazilian national whose first language was Portuguese, was involved in a road traffic accident in May 2018 while working as a delivery driver. He issued a claim seeking damages including replacement vehicle hire charges exceeding £46,000. The case was settled for £20,000 on the day of trial, with costs summarily assessed at £13,746.03. However, the Deputy District Judge refused to include the interpreter's fee of £924 as a recoverable disbursement, relying on the decision in Cham v Aldred [2019] EWCA Civ 1780.\n\n## Key Issues\n- Whether an 'agency component' within the interpreter's fee is recoverable\n- Whether the interpreter's fee of £924 was proportionate and reasonable\n- The relevance of the professional interpreter being sourced through a company with connections to the claimant's solicitors\n\n## Highlights\n> \"As a starting point it seems to me that one has to focus on the fact that the Court of Appeal held that an interpreter's fee was recoverable under sub-paragraph CPR 45.29I(h) because it was a disbursement within the proper construction of that sub-paragraph. That means that unless it is a disbursement and insofar as it is not a disbursement it is not recoverable.\"\n\n> \"In my judgment, in accordance with the guidance given by Lord Hoffmann it seems to me that in considering whether the Interpreter's Fee was reasonable I must have regard to the market.\"\n\n## Outcome\nThe court held that the interpreter's fee was a legitimate disbursement recoverable under CPR 45.29I(h), rejecting arguments that an 'agency component' should be stripped out or that the fee should be assessed at nil due to lack of breakdown. However, the court reduced the fee from £924 to £794.40 (including VAT) on the grounds of reasonableness and proportionality, based on market evidence of comparable interpreter services.",
