    "content": "# Santiago v MIB [2025] EWHC 270 (Costs)\n\n## Summary\nThis case concerns the assessment of interpreter fees as a disbursement following a Court of Appeal decision that such fees are recoverable in principle under CPR 45.29I(h).\n\n## Participants\n- Raphael De Lima Santiago (Claimant)\n- Motor Insurance Bureau (Defendant)\n- His Hon Judge Dight CBE (Judge)\n- Ben Williams KC (for the Claimant)\n- Robert Marven KC (for the Defendant)\n\n## Background\nThe claimant, a Brazilian national whose first language was Portuguese, was involved in a road traffic accident in May 2018 while working as a delivery driver. He issued a claim seeking damages including replacement vehicle hire charges exceeding £46,000. The case was settled for £20,000 on the day of trial, with costs summarily assessed at £13,746.03. However, the Deputy District Judge refused to include the interpreter's fee of £924 as a recoverable disbursement, relying on the decision in Cham v Aldred [2019] EWCA Civ 1780.\n\n## Key Issues\n- Whether an 'agency component' within the interpreter's fee is recoverable\n- Whether the interpreter's fee of £924 was proportionate and reasonable\n- The relevance of the professional interpreter being sourced through a company with connections to the claimant's solicitors\n\n## Highlights\n> \"As a starting point it seems to me that one has to focus on the fact that the Court of Appeal held that an interpreter's fee was recoverable under sub-paragraph CPR 45.29I(h) because it was a disbursement within the proper construction of that sub-paragraph. That means that unless it is a disbursement and insofar as it is not a disbursement it is not recoverable.\"\n\n> \"In my judgment, in accordance with the guidance given by Lord Hoffmann it seems to me that in considering whether the Interpreter's Fee was reasonable I must have regard to the market.\"\n\n## Outcome\nThe court held that the interpreter's fee was a legitimate disbursement recoverable under CPR 45.29I(h), rejecting arguments that an 'agency component' should be stripped out or that the fee should be assessed at nil due to lack of breakdown. However, the court reduced the fee from £924 to £794.40 (including VAT) on the grounds of reasonableness and proportionality, based on market evidence of comparable interpreter services.",

The claimant was ordered to pay costs on the indemnity basis. Permission to appeal was refused by Stuart-Smith LJ. The second defendant's bill had already been assessed, with the claimant's challenge being denied due to non-compliant Points of Dispute.\n\n## Highlights\n> \"These [Points of Dispute] could scarcely be less compliant: They are the antithesis of short, to the point and focussed. They are prolix (32 pages in length), discursive, and unfocused.\"\n\n> \"The bottom line is that the wholesale defects in the PoDs make it impossible to conduct the assessment in a manner which is fair, manageable, proportionate and in accordance with the overriding objective.\"\n\n> \"It is therefore vital that parties and their advisers properly apply their minds to the practicalities of what a hearing will actually involve and provide realistic time estimates reflecting this. Failing to do so constitutes a breach of the duty under CPR 1.3 to help the court further the overriding objective.\"\n\n## Outcome\nThe majority of the claimant's Points of Dispute were struck out as non-compliant, with only three points (1, 31, and 49.6) deemed sufficiently compliant to proceed. The claimant's allegations of misconduct were rejected. The matter was to be relisted to determine the remaining issues.",

    "content": "# BB and others v. Mr Moutaz Al Khayyat and others [2025] EWHC 443 (KB)\n\n## Summary\nThis judgment addresses costs orders following the dismissal of an application to disapply the presumptive costs rule and the striking out of certain claims.\n\n\n## Key Issues\n- Whether the Discontinuing Claimants could benefit from QOCS protection despite not having personal injury claims\n- Whether interim payments on account of costs should be ordered\n- Whether a contractual undertaking for security for costs had lapsed\n- Service issues regarding the Continuing Claimants who had no current legal representation\n\n## Highlights\n> \"In my judgment this argument is in conflict with clear decisions of the Court of Appeal including Brown; and receives no support from Achille nor from the observations of Swift J in the present proceedings. In short, these authorities show that in every case where QOCS protection falls for consideration, the exclusive focus is on the claim or claims of the particular claimant within the proceedings.\"\n\n> \"If the claim(s) of the individual claimant in question do not include a claim for damages for personal injuries, there is no QOCS protection.\"\n\n## Key Principles\n1. QOCS protection only applies to claimants who themselves make claims for personal injuries\n2. The fact that some claimants in multi-claimant proceedings have personal injury claims does not extend QOCS protection to other claimants who don't\n3. Where proceedings are struck out as an abuse of process, QOCS protection does not apply under CPR 44.15(b)\n4. Joint and several liability for costs is appropriate where claimants have made common cause in litigation\n\n## Outcome\nThe court ordered the Discontinuing Claimants to pay the Bank's costs with interim payments totaling £1.3 million. The Continuing Claimants were ordered to pay the Bank's costs with interim payments totaling £1 million. Both groups were denied QOCS protection - the Discontinuing Claimants because they made no personal injury claims, and the Continuing Claimants because their claims were struck out for abuse of process.",

    "title": " A Costs Lawyer's View: New FRC Judgment",
    "summary": "A recent judgment in MIL Collections Ltd provides a goldmine of practical lessons on the new Fixed Recoverable Costs (FRC) regime. This analysis for claims handlers covers why each successful defendant can claim their own costs, the 'timing trap' for Litigants in Person, and how to build a case for an uplift for unreasonable conduct.",
    "content": "\nA recent judgment, MIL Collections Ltd v My Shop 4 Ltd, is one of the most useful I’ve seen - it’s a goldmine of practical lessons for us as the paying party. I’ve broken down the key points from a detailed legal analysis of the case into four crucial takeaways for you.\n\nThe Case in a Nutshell\n\nA debt collection company brought dozens of flimsy claims with vague details. The court ordered them to properly plead their case. They failed, the claims were struck out, and the judge had to decide what costs they should pay to the successful Defendants.\n\nLesson 1: A Strike-Out Triggers a Full Fixed Costs Bill\n\nThe failed Claimant tried to argue that because their claim was struck out rather than \"discontinued,\" they shouldn't have to pay the main FRC figures.\n\nThe Decision: The judge firmly rejected this. A strike-out is just another way for a claim to end before trial. The Claimant was ordered to pay the Defendants' fixed costs for the relevant stage of the case.\n\nAdvice: This gives us certainty. When you successfully get a weak or poorly managed claim struck out, you can be confident that you will recover our fixed costs. It shuts down a potential technical argument from opponents trying to evade a costs order.\n\nLesson 2: Multiple Defendants Mean Multiple Sets of Costs\n\nThe Claimant sued 13 separate Defendants, and the cases were later grouped together. They hoped they would only have to pay one set of costs to be shared between all 13.\n\nThe Decision: The judge ruled that each successful Defendant is entitled to their own, separate set of fixed costs. This massively increased the Claimant's total costs bill.\n\nAdvice: This is a powerful deterrent against claimants who might speculatively sue multiple parties. If you and a co-defendant are both sued, we can tell the claimant from the outset that if they fail, they risk paying two (or more) sets of fixed costs, not just one. This significantly raises their risk profile.\n\nLesson 3: The \"Litigant in Person\" Timing Trap\n\nThis is a subtle but critical point. Two of the Defendants had solicitors helping them in the background but only put them formally on the record after the claim was struck out.\n\nThe Decision: Because they were technically \"Litigants in Person\" (LiPs) when the claim ended, their costs recovery was automatically capped at two-thirds of the fixed amount. This left them with a £2,200 shortfall each. If their solicitors had been formally on record just a few days earlier, they could have recovered the full amount.\n\nAdvice: This is a key risk management point. If you are supporting an insured who is defending a claim as a LiP, the timing of when we formally instruct panel solicitors is vital. A delay could inadvertently slash your costs recovery by a third if the case concludes unexpectedly.\n\nLesson 4: Seeking an Uplift for \"Unreasonable Conduct\" Needs Hard Evidence\n\nThe successful Defendants asked the judge to award them a 50% uplift on their costs because of the Claimant's terrible conduct.\n\nThe Decision: The judge refused. He said the Claimant was already penalised by the strike-out, and more importantly, the Defendants hadn't provided specific evidence of how the bad conduct had increased their costs.\n\nAdvice: This is a fantastic procedural tip. To win an uplift, it's not enough to just say \"the other side behaved badly.\" You must prove it caused extra work. When you see unreasonable behaviour from a claimant, instruct your panel solicitors to keep a specific record of the extra time spent dealing with it. This creates the evidence you need to justify an uplift application later.\n\nBy understanding these principles, you can make strategic decisions during the life of the claim that put us in the strongest possible position when it comes to the final costs settlement.\n\nAs always, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch.\n\nWill",
