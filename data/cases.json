While CPR 3.15(8) explicitly states that courts won't fix or approve rates during costs management, these rates inevitably influence proportionality assessments. In the recent High Court decision of <em>Pontis Finance LLP v Karam, Missick &amp; Traube LLP</em> [2025] EWHC 2298 (Ch), Deputy Master Henderson navigated this challenge, offering valuable guidance on balancing rates, time, and overall phase totals in a professional negligence claim.</p><p>This case underscores the need for robust budgeting strategies from the outset.

Read on for our analysis.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>No Fixing of Rates, But Influence on Budgets</strong>: Courts can't approve hourly rates per CPR 3.15(8), but excessive rates can lead to downward adjustments in phase totals to ensure reasonableness and proportionality.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rates + Time = Proportionality</strong>: High rates don't always spell disproportionality; it depends on hours budgeted. The same phase total could be reasonable via fewer high-rate hours or more low-rate ones.</p></li><li><p><strong>Avoid Micromanagement</strong>: As per <em>Yirenkyi v Ministry of Defence</em> [2018] EWHC 3102 (QB), courts set phase totals broadly, leaving parties flexibility on how to allocate funds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Overall Proportionality First</strong>: Assess the total incurred + budgeted costs against CPR 44.3(5) factors (e.g., value, complexity). If excessive, phase budgets may need trimming—especially in trial-focused phases.</p></li><li><p><strong>Guideline Rates as Approximations</strong>: London Bands are guides only; some work may edge toward Band 1 (heavy commercial) even in lower-value claims.</p></li><li><p><strong>Element-by-Element Balance</strong>: Disproportion in one area (e.g., solicitor rates) doesn't doom the phase if offset by others (e.g., counsel fees). Here, solicitor rates were deemed excessive, leading to reductions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trial Attendance Justified</strong>: Reasonable for KC, junior counsel, lead solicitor, and trainee to attend, but quantum must be proportionate. 10-hour trial days accepted as reasonable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Budget Reductions</strong>: Trial Preparation phase reduced from £136,550 to £115,000 (~15%); Trial phase from £88,700 to £50,000 (~44%).</p></li><li><p><strong>Comparisons Limited</strong>: Other parties' budgets offer little guidance, especially if agreed rather than court-fixed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strategic Advice</strong>: Budgets should align with case specifics from preparation stage to avoid reductions.</p></li></ol><p>This ruling highlights the nuanced approach courts take to budgeting.

KMT denied liability, putting Pontis to proof on key facts.</p><p>At the CCMC, disclosure directions necessitated updated budgets. Delays meant only Trial Preparation and Trial phases were budgeted on the papers. The core dispute: Pontis's high solicitor rates (up to £870/hr for Grade A) and dual counsel briefs, versus KMT's argument that the case—a \"relatively low-value professional claim\"—didn't justify them.</p><p>Deputy Master Henderson assessed proportionality under CPR 44.3(5), noting the claim's value (£800k–£1.2m) and factual focus, deeming it not \"very heavy commercial work.\"</p><p><strong>The Law and Authorities</strong></p><p>The judgment reaffirmed:</p><ul><li><p><strong>CPR 3.15(8)</strong>: Focus on phase totals, not rates or hours (<em>Yirenkyi</em> emphasized avoiding micromanagement).</p></li><li><p><strong>Proportionality Factors (CPR 44.3(5))</strong>: Value and complexity key; non-monetary relief, conduct, etc., not relevant here.</p></li><li><p><strong>Guideline Rates</strong>: Broad guides; Pontis's Central London firm justified Band 2 rates, but some aspects neared Band 1.</p></li><li><p><strong>Excessive Rates</strong>: Per <em>GS Woodland Court GP1 Ltd v GRCM Ltd</em> [2025] EWHC 285 (TCC) and <em>Samsung Electronics v LG Display</em> [2022] EWCA Civ 466, high rates require justification. Here, rates led to phase reductions without fixing them.</p></li></ul><p>The court first checked overall costs (£489,891 incurred + budgeted) as excessive, then scrutinised phases.</p><p><strong>Rates and Reasonable Sums</strong></p><p>Pontis claimed London 1+ rates; the court applied Band 2 guidelines as baselines, finding disparities (e.g., £870 vs. £413 for Grade A). However, a \"purely rates-based approach\" was avoided—focus was on phase wholes.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Trial Preparation</strong>: Solicitor hours reasonable, but rates excessive (35% discount suggested if isolated).

This analysis is a critical risk management lesson on the dangers of informal, undocumented 'partnership' arrangements.","content":"Today, I want to break down a judgment that should serve as a stark warning to every law firm. The SCCO decision in Global Sports Data v IPS Law is a case study in how a solicitor can perform millions of pounds of work, only for a court to rule that no retainer ever existed, rendering the entire bill irrecoverable.\n\nThe case is a solicitor's nightmare scenario, and how the firm lost is a crucial lesson in risk management for all of us.\n\nThe Background: Client or Partner?\n\nThe dispute concerned 'Project Red Card,' a large-scale group litigation project for professional athletes over data rights. The client (Global Sports Data) claimed they had entered into a commercial 'joint venture' with the solicitor (IPS Law) to pursue the claims, with each party taking a 10% share of any damages recovered. \n\nThe solicitor argued there was a standard retainer, and that Global Sports Data was their client and liable for their hourly rate fees.\n\nCrucially, **nothing was ever put in writing** between the two main parties at the outset.\n\nThe Judgment: Why the Solicitor's Claim Failed\n\nSenior Costs Judge Rowley heard evidence from both sides and concluded that the relationship was, as the client contended, a joint venture at each party's own risk. He found there was no enforceable retainer, and therefore no obligation for the client to pay the solicitor's fees.\n\nHis decision was based on a devastating analysis of the solicitor's own conduct and contradictory evidence:\n\n1. The 18-Month Delay on a Retainer Letter: This was a killer point. The solicitor only produced a draft retainer letter for Global Sports Data **18 months** into the relationship. The judge noted that the same solicitor was prompt in preparing proper client care letters for the individual athlete clients, concluding that the delay \"speaks volumes\" about the true nature of the relationship.\n\n2. Contradictory Evidence in Parallel Litigation: This was fatal to the solicitor's credibility. The judge highlighted a judgment from a separate, parallel case involving the same parties (*Safe Harbour*). In that case, the solicitor had argued they were entitled to a **10% share of damages** (a DBA/venture model). In this case, they argued they were entitled to **hourly rates**. The judge found this inconsistency completely undermined their position.\n\n3. Adverse Inferences from Missing Documents: The solicitor failed to produce key documents referenced in the *Safe Harbour* judgment, including a 'Global Agreement' and a December 2022 engagement letter. The judge drew a clear adverse inference from this, concluding the documents were deliberately withheld because they did not support the solicitor's case.\n\n4. The Predecessor Firm's 'Goodwill' Deal: The previous law firm involved in the project (Freeths) had an agreement for a potential future payment contingent on success, not a standard retainer. The judge found this supported the 'joint venture' model and that the defendant solicitor must have been aware of this context.\n\nStrategic Takeaways: A Hard Lesson in Risk Management\n\nThis case is a blueprint for how not to engage with a commercial partner:\n\n*   **No Written Retainer = Unacceptable Risk:** The entire dispute could have been avoided with a clear, written agreement from day one. An oral agreement is a recipe for disaster.\n*   **Your Conduct is Your Contract:** The court will look at how you actually behaved. If you act like a partner in a high-risk, high-reward venture, you cannot later claim you were just a solicitor charging by the hour.\n*   **Consistency is Crucial:** Providing contradictory evidence in different sets of proceedings is fatal to credibility.\n*   **Client Care is Not Optional:** A failure to provide timely and compliant client care documentation is a massive red flag to the court that a formal solicitor-client relationship may not exist.\n\nThis judgment is a powerful reminder that when the potential rewards are high, so are the risks. Without a clear, written retainer, those risks can be catastrophic.\n\n","category":"Solicitor Own Client Assessment","date":"2025-07-24","author":"William Mackenzie","tags":["Retainer","No Retainer","Solicitor Own Client Assessment","SOCA","Joint Venture","Implied Retainer","Costs","Risk Management"],"slug":"global-sports-data-ips-law-no-retainer-judgment","publishedToDiscord":false,"createdAt":"2025-07-30T12:51:50.772Z"},{"id":25,"title":"Court of Appeal Clarifies Costs Principles for Scheme & Plan Appeals","summary":"n a significant costs judgment arising from the Thames Water restructuring, the Court of Appeal has clarified the correct approach to costs in scheme and plan appeals. This analysis covers the court's decision that \"costs follow the event,\" how partial success is treated, and its stark warnings on \"eye-watering\" costs.","content":"The Court of Appeal has handed down a significant judgment on costs in the high-profile appeal concerning the Thames Water restructuring plan (Kington S.À.R.L. v Thames Water). The decision provides essential guidance for all practitioners on three key areas: the governing costs principles for these types of appeals, the treatment of partial success, and judicial scrutiny of the quantum of costs.\n\nThe Issue: Who Pays for a Failed Restructuring Appeal?\n\nThe appeal against the sanctioning of the Thames Water plan was dismissed. The court then had to decide who should pay the \"eye-watering\" legal costs, which totalled over £2.26 million for the successful Plan Company alone.\n\nThe appellants argued for two main points:\n\nThat a special costs rule should apply, similar to first-instance hearings where reasonable objectors often don't have to pay the company's costs.\nThat even if the normal rules applied, they were the \"substantive winners\" because they succeeded on key legal arguments, despite losing the appeal overall.\nThe Court of Appeal's Rulings\n\nThe court, led by the Chancellor of the High Court, Sir Julian Flaux, provided clear answers.\n\n1. On Appeal, the Normal Costs Rule Applies:\nThe court decisively rejected the idea of a special costs regime for appeals. It held that while there may be good reasons for leniency towards objectors at a first-instance sanction hearing (as they assist the court's scrutiny), the position on appeal is different. An appeal is a straightforward adversarial process. Therefore, the normal rule of CPR 44.2 applies: costs follow the event. A losing appellant can expect to pay the successful respondent's costs.\n\n2. Partial Success on Legal Issues Justifies a Substantial Reduction:\nThe court agreed that the Plan Company was the overall winner. However, it placed significant weight on the fact that the appellants had succeeded in their arguments on the underlying legal principles. The court found that this success, while a \"pyrrhic victory\" in this specific case, was important and justified a substantial reduction in the Plan Company's costs recovery. It reduced their entitlement from the 80% they sought to 60%.\n\n3. Stark Warning on \"Eye-Watering\" Costs:\nThe judgment contains some of the strongest judicial criticism of the level of modern litigation costs. The court described the fees as \"eye-watering\" and specifically highlighted:\n\nHourly Rates: Partner rates of between £1,232 and £1,400 were singled out, with the court reiterating the Samsung v LG Display principle that a \"clear and compelling justification must be provided\" to exceed guideline rates.\nTeam Structure: It criticised the instruction of \"more than eight professionals\" on an appeal that was mostly confined to issues of law.\nThis displeasure was reflected in the order for a payment on account of costs, which was limited to just 35% of the amount claimed.\n\nThis judgment is a crucial authority for anyone involved in high-value litigation, confirming that on appeal costs follow the event, but that success on significant issues and the overall quantum of costs will be intensely scrutinised by the court.\n\n\nFull Judgment: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2025/1003.html","category":"Costs Orders","date":"2025-07-30","author":"William Mackenzie","tags":["Costs Orders","Proportionality","Hourly Rates","Payment on Account","Issue-Based Costs"],"slug":"court-of-appeal-clarifies-costs-principles-for-scheme-plan-appeals","publishedToDiscord":false,"createdAt":"2025-07-30T12:35:24.440Z"},{"id":24,"title":"Unmasking the Funder: High Court Clarifies Power to Order Disclosure of Funding Arrangements","summary":"The High Court judgment in Magomedov v TPG provides a clear and detailed guide on the court's jurisdiction to order a losing party to disclose the identity of its litigation funders. This post breaks down the key legal principles and the practical use of a \"Confidentiality Club.\"","content":"In the high-stakes world of commercial litigation, the role of third-party funding is increasingly central. But what happens when a funded claim fails and the losing claimant cannot pay the costs? A new High Court judgment in the multi-billion-dollar case of Magomedov v TPG & Ors provides a powerful and practical guide to the court's power to order disclosure of funding arrangements.\n\nThe decision from Mr Justice Bryan is essential reading for claimants, defendants, and litigation funders alike, clarifying the principles behind this crucial ancillary jurisdiction.\n\nThe Issue: Identifying the Funder for a Potential NPCO\n\nThe claimants' claim had been dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, leaving them facing multi-million-pound costs orders which they appeared unable to pay. The defendants applied for an order requiring the claimants to disclose the identity and details of the third parties who had been funding the litigation, with a view to potentially making a Non-Party Costs Order (NPCO) against them under s.51 of the Senior Courts Act 1981.\n\nThe Court's Key Rulings\n\nThe claimants resisted, arguing that the defendants were unlikely to recover any further costs and that their funders' identities were confidential. The court rejected these arguments and granted the disclosure order. The judgment provides a clear summary of the applicable law:\n\nThe Test for Disclosure is Low: The court confirmed that the test is not whether a future NPCO application is \"likely to succeed.\" A court will be slow to refuse disclosure unless the potential application is \"weak or fanciful.\" The purpose of the disclosure is to allow the successful party to assess the merits of an NPCO in the first place.\nThe Court Will Not Conduct a \"Mini-Detailed Assessment\": The judge ruled it was \"inappropriate and impractical\" to conduct a detailed analysis of the likely final costs recovery on an interim disclosure application. As long as there is a real prospect of some further costs being recovered, the court will not shut the application down on quantum grounds.\nDisclosure Can Be Ordered Before Costs are Finalised: The court affirmed that there is no principle requiring a costs liability to be finally assessed or to have gone unpaid before disclosure can be ordered. In fact, joining a funder before the detailed assessment can be beneficial, as it allows them to participate in that process.\n\"Confidentiality Clubs\" are a Practical Solution: The claimants raised legitimate concerns about the confidentiality and security of their funders. The court balanced this against the defendants' right to information by ordering a \"Confidentiality Club.\" This is an increasingly common tool that restricts access to sensitive information to a limited group of people (e.g., external lawyers and named party representatives), thereby protecting confidentiality while still allowing the litigation to proceed justly.\nConclusion: A Pragmatic Approach\n\nThis judgment is a powerful statement of the court's pragmatic approach. It confirms a successful party's right to find out who funded a failed claim against them, and it demonstrates the court's willingness to use practical tools like confidentiality clubs to manage competing interests. For litigation funders, it is a stark reminder that anonymity is not guaranteed if the case they are backing is unsuccessful.\n\nFull judgment: https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/comm/2025/1996 ","category":"Litigation Funding","date":"2025-07-30","author":"William Mackenzie","tags":["Litigation Funding"],"slug":"unmasking-the-funder-high-court-clarifies-power-to-order-disclosure-of-funding-arrangements","publishedToDiscord":false,"createdAt":"2025-07-30T12:26:35.566Z"},{"id":23,"title":"Beyond Credit Hire: Who's Next? Applying the 'Tescher' Principles to Other Claims","summary":"In the joined appeals of Tescher v DAML and AXA v Spectra, the Court of Appeal has provided long-awaited guidance on when Non-Party Costs Orders (NPCOs) should be made against credit hire organisations in failed QOCS cases. This post breaks down the key legal principles from the judgment.","content":"The Court of Appeal has handed down a landmark judgment clarifying the principles for making Non-Party Costs Orders (NPCOs) against credit hire companies (CHOs) in personal injury cases where the claimant is protected by Qualified One-Way Costs Shifting (QOCS).\n\nIn the joined appeals of Tescher v Direct Accident Management Ltd and AXA v Spectra Drive Ltd, Lord Justice Birss provided detailed guidance intended to assist judges in the County Court who handle a high volume of these contentious cases. The decision allows both appeals, overturning the lower courts' refusal to make NPCOs.\n\nA New Framework for a Common Problem\n\nThe core issue was how to balance the QOCS protection afforded to claimants with the justice of making the commercial entity driving the credit hire element of the claim liable for costs when it fails. The court's guidance can be distilled into several key principles:\n\nThe \"Real Party\" Test: The court held that, as a matter of \"practical and economic\" reality, the CHO is the \"real beneficiary of the litigation\" in respect of the credit hire charges. This satisfies the test from Dymocks v Todd that the CHO is a \"real party in all but name,\" even though the claimant also has an interest in the claim.\nA Broader Approach to \"Control\": The judgment moves away from a need to prove day-to-day interference. Lord Justice Birss found that the structure of the credit hire agreement, which defers payment until the conclusion of a claim for damages, gives the CHO \"effective control in practice.\" The litigation becomes \"inevitable for all practical purposes.\"\nA Simplified Causation Test: The court rejected a strict \"but for\" test of causation. It is not necessary for a defendant to show that the CHO's involvement caused additional costs. The judgment states that the credit hire agreement itself is a \"fundamental cause of the legal costs incurred by the defendant.\"\nThe QOCS Rules Themselves Contemplate NPCOs: The court analysed CPR 44.16(2)(a), which provides an exception to QOCS for claims \"made for the financial benefit of a person other than the claimant.\" It noted that the accompanying Practice Direction (PD 44 para 12.2) explicitly gives credit hire as an example. The judgment confirms that QOCS was never intended to shield commercial non-parties from costs liability.\nRejection of the \"Lawyers on a CFA\" Analogy: The court comprehensively rejected the argument that CHOs are analogous to solicitors acting under a Conditional Fee Agreement. It found key distinctions, including that the lawyer is not the genesis of the claim and their fees are not the subject of the claim.\n\nConclusion: A Shift in Costs Risk\n\nThe practical effect of this judgment is that in a standard, impecunious credit hire case that fails, an NPCO against the CHO is now \"likely\", absent special circumstances. The decision fundamentally shifts the costs risk away from defendants and onto the commercial organisations that profit from credit hire litigation. It provides much-needed clarity and is set to have a significant impact on the conduct and settlement of these claims.","category":"NPCO","date":"2025-07-30","author":"William Mackenzie","tags":["credit hire","docs"],"slug":"beyond-credit-hire-who-s-next-applying-the-tescher-principles-to-other-claims","publishedToDiscord":false,"createdAt":"2025-07-30T11:29:50.970Z"},{"id":22,"title":"Capacity to Contract: SCCO Rules on Enforceability of a Solicitor's Retainer","summary":"A detailed judgment in Furley Page LLP v KFL provides a practical guide to how the courts will assess contractual capacity in a Solicitor-Own-Client Assessment. This analysis breaks down the key principles on the presumption of capacity, the importance of contemporaneous evidence, and the \"sliding scale\" nature of the court's findings.","content":"A new decision from the Senior Courts Costs Office, Furley Page LLP v KFL, provides a detailed and practical application of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 within the context of a solicitor's retainer. The judgment, from Costs Judge Whalan, addresses the fundamental question of when a client has the capacity to contract for legal services and the consequences for a solicitor's bill if that capacity is lost.\n\nThis case offers important lessons for any practitioner advising clients on either side of a solicitor-own-client dispute.\n\nThe Factual Background\n\nThe case involved a distinguished 91-year-old barrister who, after being diagnosed with dementia, instructed a new firm of solicitors to change his will and revoke existing Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPAs). This instruction was at the centre of a wider family dispute. The solicitor's fees amounted to over £72,000. In subsequent costs proceedings, the client argued that the entire retainer was unenforceable as he lacked the requisite mental capacity at the time he signed it in October 2020.\n\nThe Legal Framework and Competing Evidence\n\nThe court had to balance the legal presumption of capacity under the MCA 2005 with a wealth of evidence.\n\nThe Solicitor relied on several contemporaneous capacity assessments they had commissioned from a specialist consultancy at the time of the instruction. These concluded the client had capacity for the specific legal tasks.\nThe Client relied on later expert reports from a renowned consultant psychiatrist, which detailed the client's cognitive decline, and the broader context of a Court of Protection case concerning his welfare.\nThe Judge's Decision: A \"Sliding Scale\" of Capacity\n\nJudge Whalan's decision was not a simple binary finding. He conducted a detailed analysis of the evidence and established a timeline of capacity, highlighting that it is not an \"all or nothing\" concept.\n\nInitial Retainer Found to be Valid: The judge found as a fact that the client did possess the capacity to enter into the retainer in October 2020. He placed significant weight on the solicitor's contemporaneous capacity assessments, which were conducted for the specific purpose of the instruction.\n\nCapacity Can Be Lost Mid-Case: He then determined that, due to the gradual deterioration caused by dementia, the client had lost the capacity to contract by a specific later date: 22nd June 2021.\n\nKnowledge of Incapacity is the Key Date for Enforceability: The final step was to determine when the solicitor knew, or ought to have known, of this loss of capacity. The judge pinpointed this to 29th July 2021, the date of a related High Court judgment. This means the retainer was valid and enforceable up to that point, but any fees incurred after that date are vulnerable to challenge as they were not supported by a valid contract.\n\nKey Principles for All Practitioners\n\nContemporaneous Evidence is Crucial: This case is a powerful illustration that a capacity assessment conducted at the time of the event can be more persuasive than a report prepared with the benefit of hindsight, even from a more eminent expert.\nCapacity is Task-Specific and Time-Specific: The judgment demonstrates the court's granular approach. A person may have capacity for one decision (like making a will) but not another (like managing a complex retainer), and that capacity can change over time.\nThe Dunhill v Burgin Test is Central: A contract made by a person lacking capacity is voidable, not void. It can only be avoided if the other party knew or ought to have known of the incapacity. The judge's decision to pinpoint a specific date for constructive knowledge is the key to the outcome.\n\nThis judgment serves as an essential guide to the practical application of the MCA 2005 in costs litigation, showing how courts will navigate these complex and sensitive issues.\n\nBest regards,\n\nWilliam\n","category":"Solicitor and client","date":"2025-07-11","author":"William Mackenzie","tags":["solicitor and client","retainer"],"slug":"capacity-to-contract-scco-rules-on-enforceability-of-a-solicitor-s-retainer","publishedToDiscord":false,"createdAt":"2025-07-11T03:07:33.458Z"},{"id":21,"title":"A Client's Right to Know: High Court Clarifies Duty to Answer Questions on Cash Accounts - Solicitor client assessment","summary":"The High Court in Turner v Coupland Cavendish has provided definitive guidance on Solicitor-Own-Client Assessments (SOCAs). This analysis explains why the court found that a client does not need to provide evidence of wrongdoing before being entitled to answers about potential secret commissions on an ATE policy.","content":"The High Court has handed down a significant judgment in Turner v Coupland Cavendish, clarifying the rights of a former client and the duties of a solicitor during a detailed assessment of costs. This decision addresses the contentious issue of \"secret commissions\" and a solicitor's obligation to provide information, offering vital lessons for any practitioner involved in costs disputes.\n\nThe Core of the Dispute\n\nThis case concerned a Solicitor-Own-Client Assessment (SOCA) where the former client disputed the solicitor's cash account. He suspected that an undisclosed commission had been received in relation to his After-The-Event (ATE) insurance policy and sought clarification via a Part 18 Request for Further Information.\n\nThe solicitor refused to answer, arguing the request was a \"fishing expedition\" as the client had no positive evidence of any wrongdoing. The Costs Judge at first instance agreed, refusing to compel the solicitor to respond.\n\nThe High Court's Ruling: Fiduciary Duty is Key\n\nOn appeal, Mr. Justice Sweeting decisively overturned that decision. The judgment establishes a clear principle based on the fundamental nature of the solicitor-client relationship.\n\nHere are the key takeaways for all practitioners:\n\nThe Threshold for Asking Questions is Low: A client does not need to prove a commission exists to be entitled to ask questions about it. The High Court confirmed that simply having a dispute about the cash account is enough to justify a Part 18 request for clarification.\n\nThe Solicitor's Fiduciary Duty is Paramount: The court emphasized that solicitors act as fiduciaries and hold client money on trust. This creates a high duty to account for all transactions. The onus is on the solicitor to satisfy the court that the cash account is accurate, not on the client to disprove it.\n\nA \"Fishing Expedition\" Argument is Unlikely to Succeed: The court rejected the argument that asking for information about something solely within the solicitor's knowledge constitutes a \"fishing expedition.\" To rule otherwise would place the client in an impossible position, as they could never obtain the evidence needed to ask the question in the first place.\n\nThe Edwards Approach is Preferred: The judgment implicitly prefers the broader approach to inquiry seen in Edwards v Slater & Gordon, where the court facilitated investigation, over a more restrictive approach. The client's right to information is a powerful one.\n\nConclusion: A Move Towards Transparency\n\nThis judgment is a move towards greater transparency in solicitor-client dealings. For solicitors, it serves as a reminder of the high professional duties owed to clients and the need to be prepared to answer legitimate queries about financial transactions. For clients and their representatives, it provides a strong authority to press for information where there are reasonable grounds for suspicion regarding the handling of their money.\n\nIf you have any queries about navigating the detailed assessment process, whether as a receiving or paying party, please don't hesitate to get in touch.\n\nFull Judgment: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/2025/1605.html","category":"Solicitor Act Assessment","date":"2025-07-07","author":"William Mackenzie","tags":["Solicitor Act","Undisclosed commission"],"slug":"a-client-s-right-to-know-high-court-clarifies-duty-to-answer-questions-on-cash-accounts-solicitor-client-assessment","publishedToDiscord":false,"createdAt":"2025-07-07T10:35:15.665Z"},{"id":20,"title":"Navigating the FRC Cut-Off: When Do the New Rules Apply to Pre-October 2023 Settlements?","summary":"The new Fixed Recoverable Costs (FRC) rules came into force on 1st October 2023, but what happens to cases that settled before this date where costs couldn't be agreed? A key County Court decision in Bek v Simsek provides much-needed clarity on this common transitional issue.","content":"The extension of Fixed Recoverable Costs (FRC) in October 2023 was the biggest change to civil litigation in a decade, and one of the most debated topics has been the \"transitional provisions\" – the rules that decide which cases fall under the old costs regime and which fall under the new one.\n\nA recent County Court judgment in Sokar Bek v Ali Simsek has shed crucial light on a very common scenario: a non-personal injury claim that settled before the FRC rules came in, but where costs could not be agreed. Full judgment here - https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:EU:07467df5-bbe2-4917-917a-902d6a1b3e0b\n\nThe Scenario\n\nImagine a claim settles in August 2023. The parties agree on damages, but they cannot agree on the amount of legal costs to be paid. To resolve the issue, the receiving party has to issue \"costs-only\" proceedings to ask a court to assess the costs. What happens if those proceedings are issued after the 1st October 2023 deadline? Do the old, more generous costs rules apply, or the new, lower fixed costs?\n\nThe Court's Ruling: The Issue Date is Key\n\nIn Bek v Simsek, the judge provided a clear answer: the new Fixed Recoverable Costs regime applies.\n\nThe judge's reasoning was that the trigger for the new rules is when \"proceedings are issued.\" He determined that this means any kind of proceedings required to finalise the case, including the \"costs-only\" proceedings issued after the deadline.\n\nHe also noted that the receiving party's right to costs was only finalised when the court made a costs order. Since that order was made as a result of the post-October 2023 proceedings, the new rules were engaged.\n\nLessons for All Legal Practitioners\n\nThis decision has critical implications for both sides of a dispute:\n\n1. For Receiving Parties (Claimants): This is a significant warning. If a claimant settles a case close to a rule-change deadline, they must either agree the amount of costs as part of the settlement or issue protective costs-only proceedings before the deadline. Leaving it until later means risking being subject to the new, lower fixed costs.\n\n2. For Paying Parties (Defendants): This ruling strengthens their negotiating position on cases that straddle the deadline. They can now confidently argue that a failure to agree costs will result in the claimant having to issue under the new FRC regime.\n\n3. For Both: The case highlights the importance of clear settlement wording. The judge noted that parties can \"contract out\" of the FRC regime, but this must be done by way of an explicit agreement. Simply assuming the old rules will apply is no longer a safe bet.\n\nThis judgment provides welcome clarity on a complex but important issue, emphasising that timing and proactive steps are crucial when navigating major changes to the CPR.\n\nIf you have any queries about the FRC transitional rules, please don't hesitate to get in touch.","category":"Fixed costs","date":"2025-07-07","author":"William Mackenzie","tags":["fixed costs","non PI"],"slug":"navigating-the-frc-cut-off-when-do-the-new-rules-apply-to-pre-october-2023-settlements-","publishedToDiscord":false,"createdAt":"2025-07-07T04:24:39.856Z"},{"id":19,"title":"Late Costs Budget - Relief From Sanctions: High Court Overturns \"Harsh\" Decision, Stresses Need for Prejudice","summary":"A High Court appeal in Right Support Management Ltd v Hillingdon LBC has overturned a refusal to grant relief from sanctions for a costs budget filed over two years late. This analysis explores the court's focus on proportionality and the lack of actual prejudice, providing key strategic lessons for defendant handlers.","content":"A new High Court decision, Right Support Management Ltd v London Borough of Hillingdon, is a powerful cautionary tale against assuming a serious breach will automatically lead to a windfall costs victory for us. It demonstrates the court's focus on proportionality and the real-world impact of a default.\n\nCase Background\n\nThe Claim: A dispute over funding for the accommodation of a vulnerable adult.\n\nThe Breach: The Claimant filed its costs budget two years and four months late. Their application for relief from the sanction (under CPR 3.14, limiting them to court fees only) was also four months late.\n\nThe First Decision: At first instance, the judge found the breach was \"serious and significant\" and the reasons for it were not good. Applying the Denton test, he focused on the delay and reluctantly refused relief, imposing the \"harsh\" sanction. He also refused the Claimant permission to amend their claim.\n\nThe High Court Appeal: A Focus on Proportionality and Prejudice\n\nThe Claimant appealed, and Mr Justice Ritchie overturned the decision on both the amendment and relief from sanctions. His reasoning on relief from sanctions is essential for us to understand.\n\nWhile agreeing the breach was serious (satisfying the first two stages of Denton), he found the first-instance judge's analysis at stage three—considering all the circumstances—was flawed. He highlighted several critical factors that were not given proper weight:\n\nThere Was No Actual Prejudice: This was the killer point. The late budget had zero impact on the litigation timetable. No Case Management Conference (CCMC) had been missed, no trial date was lost, and no other court user was inconvenienced. The case had been delayed by other factors, including the Defendant's own failed strike-out application.\n\nContext is Everything: The first-instance judge had relied on authorities like Diriye, where relief was refused after a two-month delay. However, the High Court noted that Diriye involved the breach of an unless order where a trial date was already fixed. The context here was completely different.\n\nA Sanction Must Be Proportionate: The judge stressed that compliance with rules is not an end in itself; the rules serve justice. Depriving the Claimant of all their costs (bar court fees) in a £70,000 claim, where their breach had caused no disruption, was manifestly unjust and disproportionate.\n\nThe New, \"Proportionate\" Sanction\n\nInstead of the draconian CPR 3.14 sanction, Ritchie J granted relief but imposed a more nuanced penalty. The Claimant was ordered to pay the Defendant's costs of the application and will have their final recoverable costs reduced by 20%.\n\nStrategic Takeaways for Practitioners\n\nA Serious Breach is Not Enough: You cannot simply point to a serious default by the opponent and expect the court to automatically refuse relief.\n\nYou Must Demonstrate Prejudice: To successfully oppose an application for relief from sanctions, you must be able to show how the breach has negatively impacted your or the court's timetable. Did it cause you to do extra work? Did it disrupt a hearing date? If the answer is no, your position is significantly weakened.\n\nAnticipate Proportionality Arguments: Courts are wary of imposing sanctions that are disproportionate to the breach. Expect them to look for alternative, more tailored sanctions, like the 20% reduction seen here.\n\nThis case reinforces that while the courts demand compliance, justice and proportionality remain the ultimate goals.\n\nAs always, if you face a situation like this, please get in touch to discuss your strategic response.","category":"Costs budget","date":"2025-07-07","author":"William Mackenzie","tags":["costs budget","relief from sanctions"],"slug":"late-costs-budget-relief-from-sanctions-high-court-overturns-harsh-decision-stresses-need-for-prejudice","publishedToDiscord":false,"createdAt":"2025-07-07T03:22:45.315Z"},{"id":18,"title":" A Costs Lawyer's View: New FRC Judgment","summary":"A recent judgment in MIL Collections Ltd provides a goldmine of practical lessons on the new Fixed Recoverable Costs (FRC) regime. This analysis for claims handlers covers why each successful defendant can claim their own costs, the 'timing trap' for Litigants in Person, and how to build a case for an uplift for unreasonable conduct.","content":"\nA recent judgment, MIL Collections Ltd v My Shop 4 Ltd, is one of the most useful I’ve seen - it’s a goldmine of practical lessons for us as the paying party. I’ve broken down the key points from a detailed legal analysis of the case into four crucial takeaways for you.\n\nThe Case in a Nutshell\n\nA debt collection company brought dozens of flimsy claims with vague details. The court ordered them to properly plead their case. They failed, the claims were struck out, and the judge had to decide what costs they should pay to the successful Defendants.\n\nLesson 1: A Strike-Out Triggers a Full Fixed Costs Bill\n\nThe failed Claimant tried to argue that because their claim was struck out rather than \"discontinued,\" they shouldn't have to pay the main FRC figures.\n\nThe Decision: The judge firmly rejected this. A strike-out is just another way for a claim to end before trial. The Claimant was ordered to pay the Defendants' fixed costs for the relevant stage of the case.\n\nAdvice: This gives us certainty. When you successfully get a weak or poorly managed claim struck out, you can be confident that you will recover our fixed costs. It shuts down a potential technical argument from opponents trying to evade a costs order.\n\nLesson 2: Multiple Defendants Mean Multiple Sets of Costs\n\nThe Claimant sued 13 separate Defendants, and the cases were later grouped together. They hoped they would only have to pay one set of costs to be shared between all 13.\n\nThe Decision: The judge ruled that each successful Defendant is entitled to their own, separate set of fixed costs. This massively increased the Claimant's total costs bill.\n\nAdvice: This is a powerful deterrent against claimants who might speculatively sue multiple parties. If you and a co-defendant are both sued, we can tell the claimant from the outset that if they fail, they risk paying two (or more) sets of fixed costs, not just one. This significantly raises their risk profile.\n\nLesson 3: The \"Litigant in Person\" Timing Trap\n\nThis is a subtle but critical point. Two of the Defendants had solicitors helping them in the background but only put them formally on the record after the claim was struck out.\n\nThe Decision: Because they were technically \"Litigants in Person\" (LiPs) when the claim ended, their costs recovery was automatically capped at two-thirds of the fixed amount. This left them with a £2,200 shortfall each. If their solicitors had been formally on record just a few days earlier, they could have recovered the full amount.\n\nAdvice: This is a key risk management point. If you are supporting an insured who is defending a claim as a LiP, the timing of when we formally instruct panel solicitors is vital. A delay could inadvertently slash your costs recovery by a third if the case concludes unexpectedly.\n\nLesson 4: Seeking an Uplift for \"Unreasonable Conduct\" Needs Hard Evidence\n\nThe successful Defendants asked the judge to award them a 50% uplift on their costs because of the Claimant's terrible conduct.\n\nThe Decision: The judge refused. He said the Claimant was already penalised by the strike-out, and more importantly, the Defendants hadn't provided specific evidence of how the bad conduct had increased their costs.\n\nAdvice: This is a fantastic procedural tip. To win an uplift, it's not enough to just say \"the other side behaved badly.\" You must prove it caused extra work. When you see unreasonable behaviour from a claimant, instruct your panel solicitors to keep a specific record of the extra time spent dealing with it. This creates the evidence you need to justify an uplift application later.\n\nBy understanding these principles, you can make strategic decisions during the life of the claim that put us in the strongest possible position when it comes to the final costs settlement.\n\nAs always, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch.\n\nWill","category":"Fixed costs","date":"2025-07-06","author":"William Mackenzie","tags":["Fixed Costs","FRC","Multiple Defendants","Strike Out","Litigant in Person","Unreasonable Conduct","CPR 45","Fast Track"],"slug":"-a-costs-lawyer-s-view-new-frc-judgment","publishedToDiscord":false,"createdAt":"2025-07-07T03:17:47.397Z"},{"id":17,"title":"BB and others v.

Master Whalan acknowledged that COP work can involve substantial responsibility and complexity, and agreed that the GHR should be subject to some form of uplift to reflect inflation and changing commercial conditions. He directed that, moving forward, hourly rates up to 120% of the 2010 GHR should be considered prima facie reasonable for COP work, allowing for greater flexibility in assessments.\n\n## Participants\n- Paul Nigel Tate\n- Natasha Molloy of Freeths LLP\n- Nottingham\n- Clarion\n- the Civil Justice Council\n- Master O'Hare\n- Master Haworth\n- Mr N.
